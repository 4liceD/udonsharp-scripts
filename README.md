# udonsharp-scripts
 This repo is used to save my udonsharp scripts for easier management.
 Feel free to use them if you think they're handy.
 
 Scripts:
 
 DaysPassed:
 Allows to set a start date in unix time.
 The script calculates the difference to the current date and 
 pastes the difference in days in a TextMeshPro text field that is attached to the same gameobject.

Similiar to DaysPassed but counts down to a set date in unix time

PlayerToTMP:
Pastes the local player name into a textmeshpro textfield
